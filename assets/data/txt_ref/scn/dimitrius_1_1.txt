Ar(neutral) - Hmm, what's up with the commotion?  & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_0
Ro - I'm not sure. Looks like someone popular is paying us a visit? & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_1
Ar - Hey you, what's going on?  & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_2

G - What, are you some country bumpkin? It's the Ancestral Cult's priest.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_3
Ar(neutral) - What cult? & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_4
Ro - Ancestral Cult. They are the most popular religious group around here.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_5
Ro - It seems even goblins hold them in high regards. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_6
Ar - Anyway, what's up with the disrespect? Don't you know I'm your mayor? & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_7
G - Whatever, dumbass. I didn't vote for you.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_8

The goblin defiantly walks away from Arron.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_9
Ar(neutral) - That bastard...  & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_10
Ar - Rose, we should build a jail. And maybe institute new laws to punish disrespectful folk. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_11
Ro - Maybe we should see why this priest came by instead? & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_12
Ro(sarcastic) - You know, as your duty as mayor. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_13
Ar - Fine. But I refuse to treat him seriously on the inside.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_14
Ro(sarcastic) - Maybe you should, given he probably has more authority here than you. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_15

D - ...This is why you should always keep your eyes open and report any suspicious activities. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_16
D - Hmm? You must be the new ruler of this village. My name is Demitrius. Pleased to meet you. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_17
Ro(talk) - This is the Mayor, Sir Arron. And my name is Rose.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_18
Ro - We are pleased to meet you as well. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_19
Ar - Hmm? What were you talking about just now? & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_20
D - This is my mission, to explain to everyone the danger of Demons. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_21

D - Despite how peaceful this world might look to you, there are evil beings we call Demons, who always aim to invade and destroy all that is good for us. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_23
Ar(neutral) - Seems nasty. Why would they do this? & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_24
D - They feed on the world's life energy and since their world has become a barren wasteland, they have been attempting to come here for centuries. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_25
Ro - What do they look like? & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_26
D - They take many forms, but mostly they disguise themselves as sentient beings. This is why you should be especially careful around any strangers. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_27
D -  They might lie about how they lost their memory or came from some other world, but our interrogations have shown it all to be lies. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_28
D - Anyone, looking suspicious or having appeared from nowhere should be reported to Ancestral Cult immediately.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_29
D - So we are doing our best to keep the peace.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_30
Ro - *Gulp* & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_31
Ar - You are doing God's work, Demitrius, we'll make sure to contact you immediately.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_32
Ar - If that's the only thing you've came for, we can do our best to help you with supplies on your way back. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_33
D - I'm glad you asked. In fact, I have a cult's mission on my shoulders, I'd be pleased to have your help.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_34
Ar - What could it be? & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_35
D - There has been a report about an unknown artifact located in some nearby caverns.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_36
D - Sometimes such things appear in our world and if it's connected to Demons, it's my job to ensure it's harmless. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_37
D - As you can see, I'm no fighter, so your escort would be greatly appreciated. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_38
Ro - (With all respect, I think it would be best for us to refuse this task.) & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_39
G - Of course our mayor will gladly help you out, Father. He often skirmishes outside and can handle himself in battle. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_40
Ar - ... I guess we should've hurried with enacting those new laws. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_41
Ar(neutral) - I mean, we gladly will help you out, Father Demitrius. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_42
D - I'm glad to know this village is so high spirited.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_43
D - Once you prepare, I'll be waiting for you at the exit. & EV_DIMITRIUS_1_1_44
