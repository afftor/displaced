Defeated Victor fell on his knees not in any condition to continue the fight. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_0
V - Ghhh... How... Can I lose... & EV_VICTOR_2_4_1
V - After all... these years... & EV_VICTOR_2_4_2
V - Defeated... by a bunch of kids... & EV_VICTOR_2_4_3
Ar(neutral) - This is over, you bastard.  & EV_VICTOR_2_4_4
Ar(neutral) - Ember.  & EV_VICTOR_2_4_5
Em - ...*nod* & EV_VICTOR_2_4_6
Ember steadily advanced to crouching man. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_7
V - You think... I'm scared of you?...  & EV_VICTOR_2_4_8
*Crack* & EV_VICTOR_2_4_9
=SOUND hit=
Em - ... & EV_VICTOR_2_4_10
Ember's fist struck into Victor's face. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_11
As Victor's skull cracked, the blade fell from his hand. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_12
Ar - That was an uninspired last line. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_13
Ro - Wha... What's going on? & EV_VICTOR_2_4_14
A blade from Victor's hand began shining as it was covered in cracks.  & EV_VICTOR_2_4_15
After a loud explosion streams of energy began dissipating in all directions. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_16
Ar - These are... & EV_VICTOR_2_4_17
Ri(talk) - Dragons souls are being freed.  & EV_VICTOR_2_4_18
Ri(talk) - He can't suppress them any longer inside of his sword. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_19
Em - Ah...  & EV_VICTOR_2_4_20
Er - Wow, that's quite a sight. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_21
Ro - Look, something happens to Ember! & EV_VICTOR_2_4_22
Being close to the streams, a shining essence has been drawn from Ember's hands. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_23
=BG scenes/ember_dragon=
The essence near ember began to form into a dragon shape. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_24
Em - Is this... & EV_VICTOR_2_4_25
Em - M-mother? & EV_VICTOR_2_4_26
Ezet - Yes. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_27
Ezet - This seems to be at an end. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_28
Ezet - I'm proud of you, Ember. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_29
Ezet - Sorry, I was a terrible parent. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_30
Em - No. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_31
Em - You were with me all this time.  & EV_VICTOR_2_4_32
Em - And you gave birth to me. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_33
Ezet - You've grown well. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_34
Em - Thank you. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_35
Em - What happens now? & EV_VICTOR_2_4_36
Ezet - You have freed their souls. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_37
Ezet - Now they can be reborn into a new hatchling. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_38
Em - So, we saved them? & EV_VICTOR_2_4_39
Ezet - Yes, you've done a great deed. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_40
Ezet - But it seems I'll have to go too. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_41
Em - ... & EV_VICTOR_2_4_42
Em - Thanks for staying with me all this time.  & EV_VICTOR_2_4_43
Ezet - Heh, I was sure you'd be crying here. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_44
Em - Maybe we can meet again? & EV_VICTOR_2_4_45
Ezet - After rebirth we will not remember who we were in previous life. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_46
Ezet - But I'm glad you have found your place and friends you can rely on. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_47
Ezet - Arron. You are still to face great dangers, but I trust you to take care of my daughter. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_48
Ar - Hmm... I'm not sure I'm up to the responsibility yet.  & EV_VICTOR_2_4_49
Ezet - Don't worry, I'm  sure you can make Ember some fine offspring with some practice. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_50
Em - Eh?! & EV_VICTOR_2_4_51
Ezet - After all I've almost had first-hand experience. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_52
Ar - You had what?! & EV_VICTOR_2_4_53
Ezet - Don't act so surprised now. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_54
Ezet - My daughter is too innocent to take initiative, so I gave her a couple of hints. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_55
Ar - ...And took some liberty in the bedroom...? & EV_VICTOR_2_4_56
Ezet - That was the best for all of us. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_57
Ezet - But it's time for me to go. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_58
Ezet - Good luck, children. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_59
With last words vanishing in the air so did the image of Ezet. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_60
=BG forest 1=
Ar - ...Look, it wasn't as lewd as you imagine.  & EV_VICTOR_2_4_61
Ro - Disgusting. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_62
Em - Ah, so that's why I acted like that. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_63
Ri - ... & EV_VICTOR_2_4_64
Er - Kinky. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_65
I(sad) - Hmm I'm not sure how ancestors would feel about it. & EV_VICTOR_2_4_66
Ar - Okay, enough.  & EV_VICTOR_2_4_67
Ar - Let's get out of here, before someone sees us and blames us for murdering Aeros's hero.  & EV_VICTOR_2_4_68
