I - Sir Arron!? & EV_IOLA_2_4_5
Ar - I prefer "Prince Charming" at times like this. & EV_IOLA_2_4_6
Ro(sarcastic) - Ha-ha. & EV_IOLA_2_4_7
Ar(neutral) - What have you been doing here? & EV_IOLA_2_4_8
I(sad) - Father imprisoned me but I'm not sure why. & EV_IOLA_2_4_9
I(sad) - He's been acting weird and I eavesdropped on his guest. & EV_IOLA_2_4_10
Ar - Curious, but I think it would be better if we leave first. & EV_IOLA_2_4_11
Ar - Your colleagues don't seem very friendly either. & EV_IOLA_2_4_12
I(sad) - No, I can't. & EV_IOLA_2_4_13
I - It's father's order so there should be some reason. & EV_IOLA_2_4_14
Ar(neutral) - Look, your father locked you in a jail like this. & EV_IOLA_2_4_15
Ar(neutral) - Even if he's not psycho, you won't make things better by staying here. & EV_IOLA_2_4_16
Ro - Plus he ordered the guards to attack us.  & EV_IOLA_2_4_17
Ro - It's not sane to stay here. & EV_IOLA_2_4_18
I(sad) - No, this must be some mistake. & EV_IOLA_2_4_19
I - I'm sure he can understand if I talk to him. & EV_IOLA_2_4_20
However, the armed group gathered on the other side of the hall. & EV_IOLA_2_4_21
=MUSIC event_combat=
Guard - We cornered them!  & EV_IOLA_2_4_22
Guard - Archers, ready! & EV_IOLA_2_4_23
Guard_2 - But Lady Iola is there. & EV_IOLA_2_4_24
Guard - Damnit, did these bastards plan this out? & EV_IOLA_2_4_25
=SPRITE demitrius=
D - Shoot.  & EV_IOLA_2_4_26
Guard - Eh?!  & EV_IOLA_2_4_27
Guard - But Father, there's your daughter in the cell. & EV_IOLA_2_4_28
I - Please wait! & EV_IOLA_2_4_29
D - She was brainwashed by the foul demons. & EV_IOLA_2_4_30
D - There's no other choice.  & EV_IOLA_2_4_31
I(shock) - Wha!... & EV_IOLA_2_4_32

*Splurt* & EV_IOLA_2_4_37
Ri - Ugh... & EV_IOLA_2_4_38
Before arrows hit their target, Rilu jumped in front of them, shielding others with her body. & EV_IOLA_2_4_39
I - Rilu?! & EV_IOLA_2_4_40
I - NO! & EV_IOLA_2_4_41
Ar - Ember! & EV_IOLA_2_4_42
Em - Yes?  & EV_IOLA_2_4_43
Ar - Bust an opening so we can escape. & EV_IOLA_2_4_44
Ar - Erika, take Rilu, I'll grab Iola. & EV_IOLA_2_4_45
Er - Gotcha. & EV_IOLA_2_4_46

A shockwave and further trembling threw soldiers of balance making them unable to continue that attack. & EV_IOLA_2_4_49

I(shock) - Eh? She's alive! & EV_IOLA_2_4_58
Ri - Pull the arrow from my... *cough* lung. & EV_IOLA_2_4_59
Rilu stoically endured arrows being pulled out of her body. & EV_IOLA_2_4_60
I - You look like you are really in pain. Let me help you. & EV_IOLA_2_4_61
Ri - Don't worry, I'm used to it. & EV_IOLA_2_4_62
Ar - Weirdly enough she's immortal. & EV_IOLA_2_4_63
I - Oh... Thank goodness. & EV_IOLA_2_4_64
I(sad) - I can't believe my father ordered them to kill me... & EV_IOLA_2_4_65
I - I want to thank you all for my rescue. & EV_IOLA_2_4_66
I(sad) - I don't know what I should do now, though. & EV_IOLA_2_4_67
Ar - You are welcome to live with us.  & EV_IOLA_2_4_68
Ar - It's not fancy but folk here is pretty friendly. & EV_IOLA_2_4_69
Ar - I'm afraid your father won't be generous to us any time soon though.  & EV_IOLA_2_4_70
I(sad) - I don't know, I don't wanna be a bother to you. & EV_IOLA_2_4_71

Ri - ... & EV_IOLA_2_4_77
I - I'm not sure how I can ever repay you for this. & EV_IOLA_2_4_78
