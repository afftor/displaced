In a large hall an unknown man laid defeated as Rilu was inspecting something in her hand. & EV_RILU_2_4_0
Ar(neutral) - Rilu? What's been going on here? & EV_RILU_2_4_1
Ri - Arron. & EV_RILU_2_4_2
Ri - You've been following me? & EV_RILU_2_4_3
?(Z) - You should stop her... If you want to live. & EV_RILU_2_4_4
Ar(neutral) - Hmm? Who's this guy? & EV_RILU_2_4_5
Ri - It's Zelroth. He used to be my student in the past. & EV_RILU_2_4_6
Ar(neutral) - I think I've heard this name in town.  & EV_RILU_2_4_7
Ri - He used to be a gifted scientist and a doctor, but now he seems to prefer to raise the dead instead. & EV_RILU_2_4_8
Ar - ...And that thing in your hand? & EV_RILU_2_4_9
Ri - ........ & EV_RILU_2_4_10
Rilu demonstrates a small black ring.  & EV_RILU_2_4_11
Ri - It's an ancient artifact - The Circle. & EV_RILU_2_4_12
=SPRITE zelroth=
Z - She plans to destroy the world with it. & EV_RILU_2_4_13
Ar - What? & EV_RILU_2_4_14
Ri(spell) - Stay down. & EV_RILU_2_4_15
=SPRITE_HIDE=
Invisible force has pushed Zelroth back onto the floor. & EV_RILU_2_4_16
Z - Gh!.. & EV_RILU_2_4_17
Despite that he continued to talk. & EV_RILU_2_4_18
Z - Long time ago an ancient race had this ring. & EV_RILU_2_4_19
Z - It's the ultimate doomsday device. & EV_RILU_2_4_20
Z - And it's capable of destroying our whole reality. & EV_RILU_2_4_21
Ar(neutral) - That's a bit hard to imagine. & EV_RILU_2_4_22
Z - Why don't you ask your "friend" then. & EV_RILU_2_4_23

Ar(neutral) - ...Rilu? & EV_RILU_2_4_24
Ri(talk) - I believe it to be true. & EV_RILU_2_4_25
Ri - The world is in perpetual motion.  & EV_RILU_2_4_26
Ri - People are born, live and die, their children are born to repeat the cycle.  & EV_RILU_2_4_27
Ri - The sun rises only to set and then repeats this cycle indefinitely & EV_RILU_2_4_28
Ri(talk) - That's the nature of existence, the one we are in, at least. & EV_RILU_2_4_29
Ri(talk) - The Circle supposedly can stop it once and for all. & EV_RILU_2_4_30
Ar(neutral) - You came here for this? & EV_RILU_2_4_31
Ri - Yes. This was my goal all along.  & EV_RILU_2_4_32
Ri - I was planning for it long before we met. & EV_RILU_2_4_33
Ri - I have deceived you so I could find the ring. & EV_RILU_2_4_34
Ar(neutral) - But why? & EV_RILU_2_4_35
Ri - I can explain, but I don't expect you to understand it. & EV_RILU_2_4_36
Ar(neutral) - No hurt in trying. & EV_RILU_2_4_37
Ri - ... & EV_RILU_2_4_38
Ri - I hate this world.  & EV_RILU_2_4_39
Ri - And I hate this life.   & EV_RILU_2_4_40
Ri(talk) - I have been evil all along. & EV_RILU_2_4_41
Ri(talk) - And I want it to be destroyed.  & EV_RILU_2_4_42
Ar(neutral) - But why would you kill yourself?  & EV_RILU_2_4_43
Ri(talk) - *Sigh* & EV_RILU_2_4_44
Ri - Because life to me is endless suffering. & EV_RILU_2_4_45
Ri - I've told you before, my existence is nothing but agony. & EV_RILU_2_4_46
Ri(talk) - I'm dead tired of being injured, tortured, left at the mercy of a mob or a toy for some maniac. & EV_RILU_2_4_47
Ar(neutral) - I don't get it. Aren't you fine now? Don't you have fri- & EV_RILU_2_4_48
Ri - I said, you won't understand it. & EV_RILU_2_4_49
Ri - This is only a glimpse of peace in my eternity. & EV_RILU_2_4_50
Ri - These never last long for me. & EV_RILU_2_4_51
Ri(talk) - You can live and die, but I'll keep existing. & EV_RILU_2_4_52
Ri - I'll be feared and hunted again in no time. & EV_RILU_2_4_53
Ri - This is the cycle of my life, and I hate it.  & EV_RILU_2_4_54
Ri - I hate people and nothing is better than ending it once for all. & EV_RILU_2_4_55
Ar(neutral) - ...Is that really so?  & EV_RILU_2_4_56
Ri(talk) - You won't stop me.  & EV_RILU_2_4_57
Ar(neutral) - I don't believe you.  & EV_RILU_2_4_58
Ri(talk) - Stop being stup- & EV_RILU_2_4_59
Ar(neutral) - You are right. I can't understand how terrible your suffering was.  & EV_RILU_2_4_60
Ar(neutral) - But I do understand that it's bad enough to make you wish to end the world. & EV_RILU_2_4_61
Ar(neutral) - It must be why you show so few emotions too. & EV_RILU_2_4_62
Ar(neutral) - Must really put off the bastards who tortured you for fun. & EV_RILU_2_4_63
Ri - ....... & EV_RILU_2_4_64
Ar(neutral) - But you are also lying through your teeth. & EV_RILU_2_4_65
Ar(neutral) - You aren't evil, and you absolutely don't hate people. You hardly used us either. & EV_RILU_2_4_66
Ri - You are not making any sense. & EV_RILU_2_4_67
Ar(neutral) - Despite all hardships you don't blame others. & EV_RILU_2_4_68
Ar(neutral) - And you don't show any real grudge towards them. & EV_RILU_2_4_69
Ar(neutral) - You care for me and you cared enough to save Iola, even though you hardly knew her. & EV_RILU_2_4_70
Ar(neutral) - You pretend to be evil, because this way you hope to make me reject you. & EV_RILU_2_4_71
Ar(neutral) - So you would have an easier time doing what you've planned & EV_RILU_2_4_72
Ar - But I won't hate you.  & EV_RILU_2_4_73
Ar - And I'm sure the other villagers and girls like you as well. & EV_RILU_2_4_74
Ri(talk) - ...Shut up. & EV_RILU_2_4_75
Ar(neutral) - What happened to you is unfortunate... No, terrible.  & EV_RILU_2_4_76
Ar - But I can swear to you that nobody will abuse you as long as I live. & EV_RILU_2_4_77
Ar - This might be not much for you, but this much I can guarantee.  & EV_RILU_2_4_78
Ar - Don't you think that killing us all can wait for some time?  & EV_RILU_2_4_79
Ar - I can't stop you after I'm dead anyway. & EV_RILU_2_4_80
Ri - ...Y-You won't fool me.	 & EV_RILU_2_4_81
Ar(neutral) - You know I'm being serious.  & EV_RILU_2_4_82
Ri - (What's this... Why am I trembling?) & EV_RILU_2_4_83
Ar(neutral) - So, what do you say?  & EV_RILU_2_4_84
Ar - The others might get worried if they find out we are missing.  & EV_RILU_2_4_85
Ar - And it looks like something got in your eyes. & EV_RILU_2_4_86
Ri - ...... & EV_RILU_2_4_87
Rilu wiped her face with a sleeve. & EV_RILU_2_4_88
Ri(talk) - ...Fine, I'll trust you.  & EV_RILU_2_4_89
Ri - Let's go th- & EV_RILU_2_4_90
Before Rilu could finish her sentence a large monster broke into the hall. & EV_RILU_2_4_91

C - Raaargh! & EV_RILU_2_4_95
Before they managed to react, the monster charged into Rilu. & EV_RILU_2_4_96
Ar(shock) - Oh shit! & EV_RILU_2_4_97
Arron tackled Rilu out of the way and they both tumbled onto the floor as the monster missed them. & EV_RILU_2_4_98

Ar - Whew... That was a handy trick. Are you alright? & EV_RILU_2_4_104

Ri - I didn't think I'd be returning though. & EV_RILU_2_4_106
Ar - At least you are not doing it alone.  & EV_RILU_2_4_107
Ar(neutral) - What happened to The Circle? & EV_RILU_2_4_108
Ri - I dropped it when you pushed me. & EV_RILU_2_4_109
Ar(neutral) - Oh... Sorry. & EV_RILU_2_4_110
Ri - It's fine.  & EV_RILU_2_4_111
