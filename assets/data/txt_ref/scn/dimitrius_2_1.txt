Ro - Maybe we should've helped the survivors back in the city. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_0
Ar(neutral) - We have enough to deal with on our hands already. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_1
Ro - What are we gonna do about Dimitrius though? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_2
Ar(neutral) - Maybe we won't do anything.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_3
Ar(neutral) - He seems to be quite dangerous, but isn't really hostile. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_4
Ro(talk) - What do you mean? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_5
Ro(talk) - Now since he got those powers we won't be able to go back too. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_6
Ar - Rose, why do you think I want to go back?  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_7
Ar(neutral) - To live the rest of my life in the shadow of my brother, who attempted to get rid of me? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_8
Ar - Not to mention being chained to the palace and deal with all the dumb people there.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_9
Ro - But it was our home.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_10
Ar(neutral) - Yes, except nobody is waiting for us there.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_11
Ar(neutral) - I've never had the freedom to do anything useful in my life until we ended up here. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_12
Ro - But... What should I do? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_13
Ar(neutral) - You aren't my slave anymore.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_14
Ar(neutral) - You can choose what to do with your own life as well.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_15
Ro(talk) - But I don't- & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_16
Ro - ...I understand. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_17
Ro - I don't think we can ignore what's going on around anymore. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_18

Ro - Iola? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_23
I - Evening, Rose.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_24
I - I'll have to borrow you for a moment. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_25
Ro(talk) - Huh? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_26

Rose found herself in an enclosed room in a place she hasn't seen before. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_30
=SPRITE demitrius_demon=
=SPRITE_UNFADE 0.3=
The small room only had two other people besides her: Iola and Dimitrius. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_31
Ro - Iola? Why..? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_32
Iola acted as she couldn't hear or see Rose.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_33
Ro(talk) - What have you done to her!? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_34
De - Why are you mortals so dense?  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_35
De - Who do you think she is?  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_36
Ro - Our friend.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_37
De - Then you should choose better friends. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_38
De - She's a member of the cult, you idiot.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_39
De - The cult, which was reestablished solely to help us invade this world. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_40
De - She was trained since her birth to succumb to our control and serve us however she might.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_41
De - Naturally I've planted a few additional suggestions when she was imprisoned, just in case it could prove to be useful. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_42
Ro - This is disgusting.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_43
De - Thanks. But I didn't ask your opinion on that. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_44
Ro - What do you want of me? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_45
De - I have a proposal for you. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_46
Ro(sarcastic) - ...I'm sorry? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_47
De - To put it briefly, I offer you to take the place of Annet.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_48
De - After her death there's some gap in ranks.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_49
De - You could fit right in and have the same powers she had. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_50
De - In return you'll only have to pledge your loyalty to me. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_51
De - Given that it will save you from the eventual demise of your kind, I see it as an extremely nice offer.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_52
Ro - ...... & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_53
De - You will have some time to think about it.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_54
De - Take her to the jail cell. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_55
I - Okay.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_56

Ar - Hey, Erika, have you seen Rose? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_58
Ar - I haven't seen her since yesterday.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_59
Er - No, it seems Iola is gone as well. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_60
Ar - Okay, this is unusual.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_61

Ar(anger) - WHAT THE HELL!? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_64
Ri - We can only guess, but Rose is held hostage.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_65
Ri - Don't think Iola is staying there willingly either. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_66
Ar(anger) - Fuck...  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_67
Ar(anger) - How did this happen... & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_68
Ar(neutral) - We must attack him. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_69
Ri(talk) - Don't be stupid.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_70
Ri - Even if by some miracle we win, he can send them anywhere with his powers. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_71
Ar(neutral) - ..... & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_72
Ri - We might have a chance, but I'll need your help. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_73
Ar(neutral) - A chance? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_74
Ri - We will need to visit the Summerhill Keep first. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_75
Ar(anger) - You expect me to leave them in this shithead's hands just like that? & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_76
Ri(talk) - I expect you to not be reckless and weight the odds. & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_77
Ri - Acting on your emotions can only make things worse.  & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_78
Ar(neutral) - ..... & EV_DIMITRIUS_2_1_79
