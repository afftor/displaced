The party came to a small ruin circle. & EV_IOLA_3_3_0
I - Alright, this must be the place. & EV_IOLA_3_3_1
Ar - Great. What do we do now? & EV_IOLA_3_3_2
I - I'll prepare the ritual. You can just wait. & EV_IOLA_3_3_3
Ar(neutral) - Damn, I hate waiting.  & EV_IOLA_3_3_4

As Iola chanted the spell, ruins began glowing with blue light. After a couple of seconds a figure appeared in front of them. & EV_IOLA_3_3_7

I(shock) - ..... & EV_IOLA_3_3_11
T - ...Sorry, Let's try this again.  & EV_IOLA_3_3_12
T - Hi. Who are you? & EV_IOLA_3_3_13
Ar - None of your fuckin' business. & EV_IOLA_3_3_14
Ro(shock) - Master! & EV_IOLA_3_3_15
Ar - What? Isn't it his way of saying 'hi'. & EV_IOLA_3_3_16
Ar - Is this even the correct guy? & EV_IOLA_3_3_17
Ri - *Nod* & EV_IOLA_3_3_18
I - I can't believe my eyes, you really are a Saint Sergius from holy texts! & EV_IOLA_3_3_19
T - ...You can call me that, if you must. & EV_IOLA_3_3_20
I - I never thought I would meet someone like you. & EV_IOLA_3_3_21
T - Hmmh? Well that was some time ago... & EV_IOLA_3_3_22
Ar - I respect your religious insight, but we kinda have some business here.  & EV_IOLA_3_3_23
I - Oh, I'm sorry. Let me explain... & EV_IOLA_3_3_24

I(sad) - So I was hoping you could help me to figure out what's going on with my father and the cult... & EV_IOLA_3_3_25
T - Did you say that the cult is searching for demons invading this world? & EV_IOLA_3_3_26
I - Yes.  & EV_IOLA_3_3_27
T - No, this is wrong.  & EV_IOLA_3_3_28
I(shock) - Eh? & EV_IOLA_3_3_29
T - Demons do not invade this world in physical form.  & EV_IOLA_3_3_30
T - They can't leave their dimension at will and enter here. & EV_IOLA_3_3_31
T - What they do instead is influence and corrupt other beings. In some cases to an extreme degree. & EV_IOLA_3_3_32
T - Like local dwarves who turned into bloodthirsty maniacs, or faeries being massive bitches. & EV_IOLA_3_3_33
Ar(neutral) - That explains quite a lot.  & EV_IOLA_3_3_34
I(sad) - I had no idea. What are demons really then? & EV_IOLA_3_3_35
T - They are entities from another dimension, who generally seek a life energy which they feed on.  & EV_IOLA_3_3_36
T - Violence, negative emotions, things like this. They would gladly enter this world but most aren't powerful enough for that.  & EV_IOLA_3_3_37
T - Once defeated they return to their realm, but strong light power can kill them entirely. & EV_IOLA_3_3_38
T - From the sound of it, I'd guess your father isn't quite himself anymore.  & EV_IOLA_3_3_39
T - But spare me from these worldly worries. Is there something else?  & EV_IOLA_3_3_40
Ar - Actually yes, I wanna know who you really are. & EV_IOLA_3_3_41
T - You don't take me for a God?  & EV_IOLA_3_3_42
Ar - Hardly. & EV_IOLA_3_3_43
T - Haha, well, let's say I'm sort of a traveller like you, except that I came here willingly.  & EV_IOLA_3_3_44
Ar - Is that so? & EV_IOLA_3_3_45
T - Well... I willingly escaped my pursuers a long time ago and chose this world.  & EV_IOLA_3_3_46
Ar - So you are basically a fugitive. Got it. & EV_IOLA_3_3_47
T - Shhh, don't tell anyone. & EV_IOLA_3_3_48
Ro - You can move through dimensions on will? & EV_IOLA_3_3_49
T - Yes, kind of, it's the power I possess. Envious? You can't have it. & EV_IOLA_3_3_50
Ro(talk) - No, but we could use your help to go home. & EV_IOLA_3_3_51
T - Hah. Hahahah.  & EV_IOLA_3_3_52
Ro - Could you please do that?  & EV_IOLA_3_3_53
T - Hmh... I could. For this you'd have to bring me something first. & EV_IOLA_3_3_54
T - There are four elements. Earth, Water, Fire and Air. & EV_IOLA_3_3_55
Ar - ..... & EV_IOLA_3_3_56
T - Their existence is focused in certain places, deep underground, vast oceans, skies and so on. & EV_IOLA_3_3_57
T - Bring me one of- & EV_IOLA_3_3_58
Before Segius could finish a sentence, a small bomb exploded, creating a blinding flash.  & EV_IOLA_3_3_59
=SOUND slash=
D - Enough of this bad joke. & EV_IOLA_3_3_60

I(shock) - NOOO! & EV_IOLA_3_3_63
De - Sorry to interrupt your party, but I kinda needed his powers. & EV_IOLA_3_3_64
De - And now I finally have them. Must thank you for finding him for me, haha.  & EV_IOLA_3_3_65
Ar(anger) - You'll pay for this. & EV_IOLA_3_3_66
Arron charged at Dimitrius from a few feet away. & EV_IOLA_3_3_67
But as his sword was about to strike, Dimitrius disappeared and quickly reappeared on the other side of the cave. & EV_IOLA_3_3_68
De - Watch out, it's dangerous to run with sharp things. & EV_IOLA_3_3_69
Ar(anger) - What the hell... & EV_IOLA_3_3_70
De - Hahaha, aren't these powers great? & EV_IOLA_3_3_71
De - Okay, have fun worms, daughter... & EV_IOLA_3_3_72
I(shock) - ..... & EV_IOLA_3_3_73
De - There's things that need to be set in motion. & EV_IOLA_3_3_74

Dimitrius teleported out of the cave leaving everyone in shock. & EV_IOLA_3_3_75
=SPRITE iola=
I(shock) - Please, don't die, I... can heal you... & EV_IOLA_3_3_76
T - You can't...  & EV_IOLA_3_3_77
T - I've been running away long enough... & EV_IOLA_3_3_78
T - This will... Get very bad... & EV_IOLA_3_3_79
T - Listen... You must stop him... & EV_IOLA_3_3_80
T - The cult... is his tool... & EV_IOLA_3_3_81
The last words of Sergius escaped his mouth as life left his body. & EV_IOLA_3_3_82
I(shock) - No, this can't be! & EV_IOLA_3_3_83
Ar - .....We must go. & EV_IOLA_3_3_84
Ar - Iola? & EV_IOLA_3_3_85

Em(sad) - I don't get it. Why is she so upset? & EV_IOLA_3_3_90
Ri - Her father just killed the saint in front of her eyes.  & EV_IOLA_3_3_91
Ri - She might not have truly known him, but it's too much to take for her beliefs.  & EV_IOLA_3_3_92
Ar(neutral) - I haven't actually considered that. & EV_IOLA_3_3_93
Em(sad) - Sorry, I still don't understand.  & EV_IOLA_3_3_94
