Taking a day off Erika walks through Aeros' market. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_0
M - Hey, elf girl.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_1
M - Looking for something specific? & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_2
Er - Nah, Just checking around. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_3
M - Oh right, you are from that desert village.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_4
M - You don't have to dress that skimpy around here though.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_5
Er - Don't worry, it's one of my favorite outfits. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_6
M - A-ha, alright then. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_7
EC - No, please let us go! & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_8

Before the man could notice it, Erika punched him into the face, quickly freeing the children after that. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_16
Er - Run kids. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_17
Without a second thought they disappeared into the crowds. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_18
RN - You... Bitch! What do you think you are doing?! & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_19
Er(anger) - The right thing. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_20
RN - You don't know who I am? I'm Hector Blackthrorn. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_21
Hearing that name made people around pay more attention as it was one of the city's strongest families. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_22
RN - Those slaves cost me 12 thousand gold. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_23
RN - You better pay up now. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_24
RN - Or should we turn you into the city guard. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_25
Er(anger) - ... & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_26
Erika noticed how people were gathering around her, attracted by the ruckus. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_27
RN - Hah, there's no way you can carry this much money in your garment though. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_28

An - What's going on here, Hector? & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_29
Er - ...? & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_30
RN - Ms. Annet? It's nothing requiring your attention.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_31
RN - This elf just made me lose a pair of freshly bought slaves. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_32
An(anger) - Trying to get your filthy hands on the poor kids again, are you? & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_33
An(anger) - That's disgusting, and it's only natural someone would want to save them. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_34
RN - This is not against the law, and I paid fair and square.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_35
RN - I demand my money back! & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_36
An(anger) - Hmph, fine. You'll have your gold, make sure it will serve something better than your perverted hobbies. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_37
Hearing this, the previously distant crowd began cheering Annet. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_38
Str - Wow, Ms. Annet really is a respectable committee member. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_39
Str2 - This is what all rich and nobles should be like. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_40
RN - Hmph, fine. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_41
RN - Have it your way, this time.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_42
After receiving the confirmation letter, Hector walked away. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_43
An - Now, that is taken care of... & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_44
An - I would like to have a word with you... & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_45
An - Your name is Erika, right? & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_46
Erika went numb from hearing her name.  & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_47
Her previous readiness to fight drains from her. & EV_ERIKA_ANNET_2_1_48
