Taking a day off Erika walks through Aeros' market.
M - Hey, elf girl. 
M - Looking for something specific?
Er - Nah, Just checking around.
M - Oh right, you are from that desert village. 
M - You don't have to dress that skimpy around here though. 
Er - Don't worry, it's one of my favorite outfits.
M - A-ha, alright then.
EC - No, please let us go!
Erika turned to the noise from the other side of the market.
A pair of captured children, no older than twelve, were sold to an obese rich man.
RN - Shut it, you cur.
RN - I've paid a good sum for you.
EC - *sob* Please, I want to see my mom.
RN - They are pretty unruly.
RN - Don't worry, you'll work off your price in bed and become real ta-
=SOUND punch=
=SHAKE_SCREEN 0.5=
Before the man could notice it, Erika punched him into the face, quickly freeing the children after that.
Er - Run kids.
Without a second thought they disappeared into the crowds.
RN - You... Bitch! What do you think you are doing?!
Er(anger) - The right thing.
RN - You don't know who I am? I'm Hector Blackthrorn.
Hearing that name made people around pay more attention as it was one of the city's strongest families.
RN - Those slaves cost me 12 thousand gold.
RN - You better pay up now.
RN - Or should we turn you into the city guard.
Er(anger) - ...
Erika noticed how people were gathering around her, attracted by the ruckus.
RN - Hah, there's no way you can carry this much money in your garment though.
=SPRITE annet=
An - What's going on here, Hector?
Er - ...?
RN - Ms. Annet? It's nothing requiring your attention. 
RN - This elf just made me lose a pair of freshly bought slaves.
An(anger) - Trying to get your filthy hands on the poor kids again, are you?
An(anger) - That's disgusting, and it's only natural someone would want to save them.
RN - This is not against the law, and I paid fair and square. 
RN - I demand my money back!
An(anger) - Hmph, fine. You'll have your gold, make sure it will serve something better than your perverted hobbies.
Hearing this, the previously distant crowd began cheering Annet.
Str - Wow, Ms. Annet really is a respectable committee member.
Str2 - This is what all rich and nobles should be like.
RN - Hmph, fine.
RN - Have it your way, this time. 
After receiving the confirmation letter, Hector walked away.
An - Now, that is taken care of...
An - I would like to have a word with you...
An - Your name is Erika, right?
Erika went numb from hearing her name. 
Her previous readiness to fight drains from her.
=BLACKFADE 0.5=
After a few minutes Erika was brought into Annet's mansion.
=MUSIC erotheme=
=ABG annet_erika_1=
=BLACKUNFADE 0.5=
In the middle of a dark cell Erika had Annet standing closely behind her.
An - Surely, it's been a long time, Erika. 
An - I wonder what have you been doing all this time.
Er - ...What do you want?
An - Well, aren't you uncharacteristically rude?
An - I guess it's only natural you'd lose some manners.
Er - .....
An - This will make things more fun.
=ABG annet_erika_2 annet_erika_3=
Annet possessively grabbed Erika from behind. 
Her hands moved over her breasts but Erika didn't stop her.
Er - Ngh... 
Against her will, Erika exhaled in a slightly excited manner.
An - Mhmm... Your body is as good as it was back there. 
An - Isn't it nice to be an elf?
An - Your firm tits are so nice to touch. 
An - Most elves are too bony.
An - It seems your body still remembers me well, Erika.
An - I can feel your nipples are very hard even through fabric. 
Er - ...No...
An - I had lots of fun playing with you.
Er - Stop it!
=ABG annet_erika_4 annet_erika_5=
Finally Erika tried to stop Annet's actions.
However Annet easily predicted it and Erika's hands were quickly cuffed above her.
An - Your behavior, on other hand...
An - I will have to train you back into a good obedient thing.
An - Just like you were.
Er - I don't want it...
An - We will see about that. 
Annet removed what little cloth was covering Erika's body, making her shiver.
=ABG annet_erika_6 annet_erika_7=
An - I'm betting my estate you will beg me to keep you around by tomorrow.
An - Because in the end, you are nothing but a little elven whore.
Er - ...You are wrong...
*Slap*
Annet's hand punished Erika with a hard slap on her butt, making her stop her protests.
An - Let's not make this too rough, dear. 
An - I want to save our reunion from needless cruelty. 
An - After all, this is the only thing you are good for.
Er - *sob*
An - Don't be sad, that's exactly how I like you.
An - And I can feel how this makes you horny.
Er - Ah...
Annet's hand reached between Erika's legs entering the damp walls of her pussy.
=ABG annet_erika_8 annet_erika_9=
An - So wet already.
Er - Ah...
An - Aren't you happy you get to play with your Mistress after so long?
Despite her resistance, Erika's legs slowly spreaded, allowing Annet easier access to her slit.
An - Ah-ha-ha, just look at this. 
An - After all these words you willingly let yourself be molested even without my request.
Er - I'm!.. No... Ah!! 
Increasing her tempo, Annet brought Erika to climax.
After that she lost any power to speak coherently.
Her mind regressed back to the times when she was fully controlled by Annet.
An - You are such a nice meat hole.
An - Cumming like this from being raped. 
Annet was gloating even without Erika fully recognizing what she said.
That was what she really enjoyed in the whole ordeal.
An - Time to give you the thing you've been waiting for.
Er - ...
=ABG annet_erika_10 annet_erika_11=
After a few moments Erika felt something long and hard entering her pussy.
Annet, wearing strap-on, grabbed the defenseless Erika from behind.
Er - Aah!..
An - Have you been missing this feeling, you whore?
An - Your cunt squeezing me so hungrily.
An - Ha-ha, and to think I was worried you'd actually become a decent person!
=ABG annet_erika_12 annet_erika_13=
Annet began thrusting into Erika's wet pussy.
An - Take this!
Er - Ohh... Yes... 
Er - More... Fuck my cunt harder...
An - Yes, you elf slut, I'll put you back in shape in no time.
An - I've missed having good toys to play with.
Er - Ngh... 
Er - Ah... Mistress...
An - Yes, shake your hips like that.
Er - I'm... cumming...
Er - The elf whore is...
Er - Going to... cum again...
An - Good, let's finish this.
=ABG annet_erika_14 annet_erika_15=
=WHITE=
With these words Annet increased speed of her thrusts, forcing Erika and herself to orgasm.
Er - AAAahhh!!!
An - Yes... Ah... Hah...
An - Like in the good old times...

Ar - Hey Rose, what happened to Erika?
Ro(talk) - She said she was going to the city market yesterday
Ro - She hasn't returned since then.
Ar - Hmm... That seems a bit unlike her. 
Ro - Would you like to investigate?
Ar(neutral) - Yeah, I've been bored from sitting around here all day.
Ar - I hope she hasn't decided to live in a big city instead.
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
=SPRITE_HIDE=
=BG town_in=
Str - The elven girl in skimpy clothes?
Str - Yeah, she was here yesterday. 
Str - Was causing some ruckus, then walked away with Annet.
Ro(talk) - Annet?
Str - Yeah, the city committee member, the one with horns.
Ar - Oh, right, that one.
Ar - What she's even about?
Str - Don't know much, really. 
Str - She was elected due to her business influence and money mostly.
Str - I think she's from an aristocratic family, or that's what she looks like anyway. 
Ar - Don't you find her weird though? 
Ar - Those horns and tail I mean.
Ar - She kinda looks like a succubus to me.
Str - Hey man, not cool. We aren’t prejudiced.
Str - Anyone can be a good person.
Str - Especially when they have lots of money.
Ar - Uh huh, I guess we should check her estate then. 
Str - Yeah... Don't tell her I told you though.
Str - And don't comment on those things. 
Str - She does not seem to like it.
Ar - ...Thanks.
=BLACKFADE 0.5=
After a half hour Arron and Rose have found Annet's estate.
=BG annet_quarters=
=SPRITE annet=
=BLACKUNFADE 0.5
=SPRITE_UNFADE 0.5=
=DELAY 0.5=
Ar - ...So we have been looking for her.
An - I see. Mr. Arron, right?
An - I do indeed know about Erika and where she is right now.
An - But there might be some difficulties.
Ar(neutral) - Such as?
An - You see, she's an old friend of mine and we have just reunited.
An - She wants to stay with me.
Ro - Does she really?
An - Of course she does, silly.
An - You don't believe me?
An - That's fine. Erika, please come in.
=SOUND dooropen=
=SPRITE erika=
=SPRITE_UNFADE 0.5=
Ro - *Huh, she looks quite disturbed*
Ar - Hey, we were worried. How are you doing?
Er(sad) - I'm sorry for my disappearance, Arron, Rose.
Er(sad) - I will be staying with M-
Er(sad) - With Annet from now.
Er(sad) - You don't have to stay here.
Ro(shock) - Huh?
=SPRITE annet=
An - As you see, she's perfectly fine and stays here by her will.
Ar(neutral) - Hmm, this does look a bit fishy.
Ro - ....
An - You are a clever man, Mr. Arron. 
An - You do look different from most people in this city. 
An - I can tell you aren't of lowly heritage.
Ar - Please, you are making me blush.
An - I'm not flattering you. 
An - I can see how others react to you, especially your companions. 
An - Rose, correct? 
Ro - ...
An - You see, to me there are two kinds of people in this world.
An - Those who rule and those who obey. 
An - Erika is obeying me, just as Rose obeys you.
An - That makes us alike, don't you think? 
Ro(sarcastic) - This is absurd.
Ar - Shush, don't make me bring your gag with us next time.
Ro(shock) - .....!
An - Ha, see! You get it.
An - You have come to me so you do hold interest in Erika. 
An - Since she has joined you before, you must be a responsible leader.
An - So I'm not wholly against letting her go.
An - But I do need someone around to help me with my... business.
An - Your girl, Rose, looks quite capable of that. 
An - What would you say if we switch for an uncertain period of time?
Ro(shock) - ..!
Rose noticed how Erika's eyes screamed "No", but did not say anything.
She was terrified by the idea of being left alone with Annet.
Ar(neutral) - This is a tempting offer...
Ar - But I'll have to consider it first.
Ar - If that's fine with you.
Ro - *C-consider?*
An - Of course not. 
An - Once you decide, I'll be waiting. 
An - I hope we can have a productive relationship in future.
Ar - Likewise.
=BLACKFADE 0.5=
Later this evening.
=BG annet_quarters=
=SPRITE rose=
An - Hello, Rose. 
An - I'm glad that you've visited me.
An - I hope you don't think of me badly because of what I said.
An - In no way have I tried to degrade you.
Ro(talk) - N-no, I understand. 
Ro - I've come on my own here. Master, I mean, Arron would not let me go.
Ro(talk) - But I want to help Erika. 
An - I can assure you, Erika is in great condition.
Ro - I'll stay with you, if you let her go.
An - *Ho my, this is perfect*
An - Sure, this is very nice of you. 
An - If you become my subordinate, I'll let Erika leave.
Ro - Okay, I will. But... 
Ro - I want to see that she's fine. 
An - Sure thing. 
An - We can visit her right now.
An - Please, follow me. 
=BLACKTRANS 0.5=
Annet and Rose went to the prison cells where Erika was held captive.
An - You know, I quite adore reserved girls like you.
An - *You are really fun to play with.*
An - But what about Arron?
An - Isn't he going to return for you?
Ro(sarcastic) - H-He does not own me anymore. 
Ro(talk) - I'm free to decide what to do.
An - Ah, is that so. 
An - You do have some unusual features, must catch quite a bit of attention.
Ro - T-that's not true. 
Ro - It's nice that you appreciate it, though.
An - *Hah, she takes my attention as a benefit*
An - *Maybe I should take her right here*
An - *maybe even next to Erika...*
An - We are here. As you can see, she's perfectly fine.
Behind the cell bars a girl's silhouette rests in the shadows.
Ro(talk) - Erika? Is that you?
Annet has put Erika's in shackles just in case she might attempt to escape.
Ro - C-can I see her closer?
An - Alright, I have a key with me.
An - Just let me unlock this...
*click*
*thud*
*fall*
Annet fell to the ground knocked out with Rose standing behind as she was unlocking the cell door. 
Rose held a small blackjack in her hand, which just got intimately acquainted with Annet’s head
Ro(talk) - *Gasp*
Ro - Keys... Hold on, Erika.
Er(sad) - ...?
Ro - I'm getting you out.
Er(sad) - Rose... 
Er(sad) - How did you-
Ro - Not now, we have to escape.
...
=BLACKFADE 0.5=
=BG town_in=
=BLACKUNFADE 0.5=
Rose dragged Erika outside where Arron and others were waiting for her.
Ro - We did it.
Ar - Well done, Rose.
Er(sad) - Arron? Girls?
Em - We took care of the patrols.
Er(sad) - I'm... not... 
Ar(neutral) - We can talk later, you need some rest.
=BLACKFADE 0.5=

After some time they safely returned home.
Ro(talk) - Thanks for the baton, Ember.
Ro - I managed to hide it so she had no idea.
Em - A-ha, it's nothing. 
Em - I'm glad I could be useful.
Er(sad) - I... was sure that I wouldn't see you again any time soon.
Ar - It was Rose's plan. 
Er(sad) - ...Rose? You risked yourself for me?
Ar - You must've fooled her well acting like prey.
Ro - It was rather scary.
Ro - I felt like she could easily push me around, if I were any younger.
Ro(sarcastic) - Or you haven't been pushing me around since childhood.
Ar - Filthy lies.
Er(sad) - I... I'm not sure I'll be able to ever repay you for this.
Er(sad) - But now you might get into trouble with city government.
Ar(neutral) - I don't think she's going to go that far.
Ar - Not until she's ready to proclaim what she was doing to you anyway.
Ar - And it's not like it's my first time getting into fights with local authorities.
Ro(sarcastic) - Please, don't make me remember.
Ar - We haven't even turned anything to cinders this time.
Er - Thank you, Rose. 
Er - I actually thought you would be happy with me gone too.
Ro(talk) - Stop it. I wouldn't feel right leaving you like that.
Ro(talk) - And I don't think bad of you, it's just... I'm...
Ro - Umh... 
Ri - She wants to say, she thinks of you as of a friend.
Ro(talk) - That's not...
Ro - Uh, well, maybe.
Er - I appreciate it.
