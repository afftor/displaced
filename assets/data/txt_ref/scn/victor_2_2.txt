Ro - I've got a letter. Looks like it's about Ember. & EV_VICTOR_2_2_0
Ar - Hmm? That's unusual.  & EV_VICTOR_2_2_1
Ro - It says "I know you are hiding a dragon offspring. Give her away or your little village will be demolished." & EV_VICTOR_2_2_2
Ro - "This is the only warning. Bring it to the Aeros' Forest entrance." & EV_VICTOR_2_2_3
Ar(neutral) - Hmm, I guess we have a new task on our hands. & EV_VICTOR_2_2_4
Ro - They make a threat against the village, and this looks like a trap. & EV_VICTOR_2_2_5
Ro - Why would they need Ember?  & EV_VICTOR_2_2_6
Ar(shock) - Who cares!? My harem is mine and if they dare to threaten it, I won't give them any mercy. & EV_VICTOR_2_2_7
Ro(sarcastic) - You really should stop seeing us as your property.  & EV_VICTOR_2_2_8
Ar(neutral) - You aren't property. I don't care about property.  & EV_VICTOR_2_2_9
Ar - I care about cute girls. & EV_VICTOR_2_2_10
Ro - Well, I guess we will know it once we get there. & EV_VICTOR_2_2_11
