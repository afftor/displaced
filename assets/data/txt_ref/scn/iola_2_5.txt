Ar - Hey, how do you like your new home?  & EV_IOLA_2_5_0
I - It's nice, thanks. & EV_IOLA_2_5_1
I(sad) - I just don't know what I should do now.  & EV_IOLA_2_5_2
I(sad) - Father has changed, he would never do something like this. & EV_IOLA_2_5_3
Ro(talk) - Uh.. I think we should tell you about the time we went with him to the caves. & EV_IOLA_2_5_4

I(sad) - That sounds really weird. & EV_IOLA_2_5_5
Ar - Just for the note, we aren't demons or anything like that. & EV_IOLA_2_5_6
Ro(sarcastic) - Not in a literal sense at least. & EV_IOLA_2_5_7
I(sad) - I believe you. & EV_IOLA_2_5_8
I - You've mentioned you are looking for some person?  & EV_IOLA_2_5_9
Ar - Yeah, according to Rilu there's someone who has been living for a really long time and probably came from another world as well. & EV_IOLA_2_5_10
Ar - And we also got this Saint Pearl from Faery Queen, which seems to be related to him. & EV_IOLA_2_5_11
I - This reminded me of Sergius.  & EV_IOLA_2_5_12
I - He's one of the Ancestors' saints.  & EV_IOLA_2_5_13
I - I've been studying it during my initiation.  & EV_IOLA_2_5_14
I - And you are planning to find him? & EV_IOLA_2_5_15
Ar(neutral) - Don't see any better options. & EV_IOLA_2_5_16
I(sad) - It's hard to believe he'd still be alive.  & EV_IOLA_2_5_17
I - He was one of the former a long time ago, but it never said what happened to him. & EV_IOLA_2_5_18
I - Please, let me help you. If he's actually the Sergius, he would know what's going on.  & EV_IOLA_2_5_19
I(sad) - Although I don't know why he would just avoid us if he's still alive. & EV_IOLA_2_5_20
Ro - Maybe he has lost his memory or something.  & EV_IOLA_2_5_21
Ar - Or just got bored of the religious stuff. & EV_IOLA_2_5_22
I(shock) - No way! & EV_IOLA_2_5_23
Ar - What? Don't you ever feel bored by the repetitive rituals? & EV_IOLA_2_5_24
Ar - It's like brushing your teeth but also everyone makes you feel guilty for not doing it. & EV_IOLA_2_5_25
Ro(sarcastic) - Master is fooling around. & EV_IOLA_2_5_26
Ro - I'm sure there must be some serious reason. & EV_IOLA_2_5_27
I - ...Thanks, I hope we will find him. & EV_IOLA_2_5_28
