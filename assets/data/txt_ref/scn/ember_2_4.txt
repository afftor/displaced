The large dragon is held in place breathing heavily. & EV_EMBER_2_4_0
Dr - Guh... Enough... & EV_EMBER_2_4_1
Dr - You've proven your strength. What do you want? & EV_EMBER_2_4_2
Ro - As we said- & EV_EMBER_2_4_3
Dr - What? & EV_EMBER_2_4_4
Dr - Speak Louder!  & EV_EMBER_2_4_5
Em - WE HAVE COME BECAUSE OF ME! & EV_EMBER_2_4_6
Dr - Hmm? What's this... & EV_EMBER_2_4_7
The huge dragon brought his head closer to the ground and observed Ember. & EV_EMBER_2_4_8
Dr - Ooh, why haven't you said so sooner.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_9
Ar - Because of your senile deafness. & EV_EMBER_2_4_10
Dr - Quiet. You'll be worse than me in mere decades. & EV_EMBER_2_4_11
Ar - ...So now you can hear. & EV_EMBER_2_4_12
Dr - You have a familiar scent. & EV_EMBER_2_4_13
Dr - What's your name, child? & EV_EMBER_2_4_14
Em - I'm Ember. Nice to meet you. & EV_EMBER_2_4_15
Em - Even though we've fought already.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_16
Dr - I see... You are the child of Ezet.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_17
Dr - Truly a wonder to meet someone like you.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_18
Em - Ezet? Is that the name of my mother? & EV_EMBER_2_4_19
Dr - Yes. You have no knowledge of your ancestry? A pity. & EV_EMBER_2_4_20
Dr - Ezet was one of our wyer. But it's from a time before we were facing today's crisis.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_21
Ro - What crisis?  & EV_EMBER_2_4_22
Dr - Hmm... I'll need time to explain. & EV_EMBER_2_4_23
Dr - We dragons possess souls unlike normal mortals. And these souls grant us sentience.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_24
Dr - When a dragon dies, his soul leaves his body and finds its way to a new one. & EV_EMBER_2_4_25
Dr - Without a soul, we are but beasts. You've met many of those on your way here.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_26
Dr - From some time ago something has changed.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_27
Dr - Dead dragons have been reborn less and less. Somehow, their souls can't find a way back here. & EV_EMBER_2_4_28
Em(sad) - No way. & EV_EMBER_2_4_29
Dr - I haven't seen anyone here for the last few years. I fear that we might be hunted.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_30
Dr - But it feels like... You might have Ezet's soul inside of you. & EV_EMBER_2_4_31
Dr - Somehow she managed to conceal herself inside of you. & EV_EMBER_2_4_32
Em - My mother inside of me? So I'm her? & EV_EMBER_2_4_33
Dr - No. It would be more accurate to say that she lays dormant, perhaps occasionally influencing your actions.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_34
Ro(talk) - Then that note was likely her doing. & EV_EMBER_2_4_35
Em - So that means... My mother is dead?  & EV_EMBER_2_4_36
Dr - Yes and no, her body is likely dead, but her soul is within you for now.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_37
Dr - I hope she will eventually be reborn as we once were. & EV_EMBER_2_4_38
Dr - Although I did not expect her to take a... Mortal partner.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_39
Dr - At times like these I will not complain.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_40
Dr - My name is Qothus. & EV_EMBER_2_4_41
Dr - I welcome you as one of my kin.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_42
Ar - Before you continue with the family reunion, there's one thing we need to ask for. & EV_EMBER_2_4_43
Dr - Yes? & EV_EMBER_2_4_44
Ro - We are currently looking for someone... & EV_EMBER_2_4_45

Dr - Curious story, but my knowledge is not enough to help you here.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_46
Dr - I don't know anything about that person or item you possess. & EV_EMBER_2_4_47
Ar - Well damn. At least I've defeated a dragon today. What do you think father would say? & EV_EMBER_2_4_48
Ro - Now that you say it, we actually did... & EV_EMBER_2_4_49
Ar - Well, Ember, take your time, we will be waiting around the corner. & EV_EMBER_2_4_50
Party leaves Ember alone with the Qothus. & EV_EMBER_2_4_51
Em - I didn't expect this would turn out like this. & EV_EMBER_2_4_52
Dr - Threads of destiny are often chaotic in nature. & EV_EMBER_2_4_53
Dr - Your mate is strong, you've chosen wisely. & EV_EMBER_2_4_54
Em - Wha-? Sir Arron is not my... & EV_EMBER_2_4_55
Dr - Or was it Ezet's influence, I wonder. & EV_EMBER_2_4_56
Em - Um, could you tell me about my mother? & EV_EMBER_2_4_57
Dr - Oh, she was one nasty rascal. & EV_EMBER_2_4_58
Dr - And a fool unlike others.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_59
Dr - Always got into fights with others. One time she even scorched Elder's nest cave. & EV_EMBER_2_4_60
Dr - ... & EV_EMBER_2_4_61
Dr - Shame I won't see her again. & EV_EMBER_2_4_62
Em - You were related? & EV_EMBER_2_4_63
Dr - We are all siblings in a sense. & EV_EMBER_2_4_64
Em - Ah, so I can call you an Uncle Qothus then? & EV_EMBER_2_4_65
Dr - This is... & EV_EMBER_2_4_66
Em - Please? & EV_EMBER_2_4_67
Dr - *sigh* Alright. & EV_EMBER_2_4_68
Em - But what should I do now? & EV_EMBER_2_4_69
Dr - You look quite accustomed to mortals.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_70
Dr - You should naturally stay with them now. & EV_EMBER_2_4_71
Dr - In truth, I don't know if we will even continue to exist for much longer. & EV_EMBER_2_4_72
Dr - I haven't seen or heard of anyone for a long time until you came. & EV_EMBER_2_4_73
Dr - So go, glide proudly and remember what you are.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_74
Dr - Don't shy away from returning here if you need help.  & EV_EMBER_2_4_75
Dr - I may look old, but a few more centuries are nothing for me. & EV_EMBER_2_4_76
Em - Thanks, Uncle Qothus I'm glad we met. & EV_EMBER_2_4_77
Ember awkwardly hugged the big dragon. & EV_EMBER_2_4_78
