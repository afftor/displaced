Ro - Master, I've found an old stone coffin in the other room. But it was too heavy to open for me. & EV_RILU_1_1_1
Ar - An old coffin? Alright, in the worst case we can settle down here as well.  & EV_RILU_1_1_2
Ro - Please don't joke about it. & EV_RILU_1_1_3
Ar - Let's see it. & EV_RILU_1_1_4

Ar - Looks pretty ancient. What are these letters? & EV_RILU_1_1_5
Ro - Does not look like anything I ever seen. & EV_RILU_1_1_6
Em(sad) - Me neither. & EV_RILU_1_1_7
=SPRITE erika=
Er - It says... 'Beware'... & EV_RILU_1_1_8
Er - 'Sealed Evil'... & EV_RILU_1_1_9
Er - Think this one means 'Undead' & EV_RILU_1_1_10
Ro - Could this be the necromancer they have been talking about? & EV_RILU_1_1_11
Er - And something about radish? & EV_RILU_1_1_12
Ar(neutral) - Radish? What does that have to do with radish? & EV_RILU_1_1_13
Er - I dunno. The letters are hard to make out. & EV_RILU_1_1_14
Ar(neutral) - You know this language? & EV_RILU_1_1_15
Er - Nah, not really. It just looks familiar.  & EV_RILU_1_1_16
Ar(neutral) - What? How do you read it then? & EV_RILU_1_1_17
Er(happy) - I might have accidentally learned it sometime in the past. & EV_RILU_1_1_18
Ar - Well, since there's nothing else to do here, let's open it. & EV_RILU_1_1_19
Ro(shock) - Master! You've heard what it says, we can't just randomly open it.  & EV_RILU_1_1_20
Ar - Whatever, it also says some nonsense we can't be sure about.  & EV_RILU_1_1_21
Ar - Don't be a scaredy-cat. & EV_RILU_1_1_22
Er(happy) - This is like a surprise box.  & EV_RILU_1_1_23
Er - There might be some treasure inside? & EV_RILU_1_1_24
Em(happy) - I wanna see treasure! & EV_RILU_1_1_25
Ro - ... I can't believe we actually made it this far. & EV_RILU_1_1_26
Ar - Alright, Ember help me out. & EV_RILU_1_1_27

Ro - Eh? & EV_RILU_1_1_30
Er - ... & EV_RILU_1_1_31
Ar - ... & EV_RILU_1_1_32
Ro - Could she be... the necromancer? & EV_RILU_1_1_33
Er - Hmm, she does give off a bit of a creepy vibe. & EV_RILU_1_1_34
Em - What do we do now? & EV_RILU_1_1_35
Ro - ...Master? & EV_RILU_1_1_36
Ar - She's kinda cute.  & EV_RILU_1_1_37
Ro(sarcastic) - ...Really? & EV_RILU_1_1_38
Arron extended his arm and poked the lying girl's face.  & EV_RILU_1_1_39
Ro(shock) - Master! & EV_RILU_1_1_40
Ar - Oh, she's actually warm. & EV_RILU_1_1_41
Ro(shock) - This is dangerous! & EV_RILU_1_1_42
Ar - Nah, it can't be. & EV_RILU_1_1_43
Ar - Cute girls can't be evil. & EV_RILU_1_1_44
Ro - No, no, that's certainly a possibility here. & EV_RILU_1_1_45
Ar - Rose, don't be so prejudiced. We might end up in a similar coffin one day. & EV_RILU_1_1_46
Ar - It would be pretty sad if you were treated evil just because of that, wouldn't it? & EV_RILU_1_1_47
Ar - Also, isn't it like a Snow White story? & EV_RILU_1_1_48
Ar - I admit, the dwarves are not quite what I imagined, but I'll take it as an unusual twist. & EV_RILU_1_1_49
Ro - I beg you, don't dare- & EV_RILU_1_1_50

Ri - Darn... & EV_RILU_1_1_56
Er - She bit her tongue... & EV_RILU_1_1_57
Ro - She seems pretty clumsy.  & EV_RILU_1_1_58
Ro - Is it because of sleep? & EV_RILU_1_1_59
Ar - We were passing by and found this place by chance.  & EV_RILU_1_1_60
Ar - I'm Arron, this is Rose, Erika, and Ember.  & EV_RILU_1_1_61
Ar - What about you?  & EV_RILU_1_1_62
Ri - Me? & EV_RILU_1_1_63

Ar - Not even gonna try. How about just Rilu? & EV_RILU_1_1_70
Ri - I don't really mind. & EV_RILU_1_1_71
Ro - Excuse me for asking, but are you a... Necromancer? & EV_RILU_1_1_72
Ro(sarcastic) - Given your look and everything... & EV_RILU_1_1_73
Ri - I think I used to be called like this at times. & EV_RILU_1_1_74
Er - So you aren't one? & EV_RILU_1_1_75
Ri - *shrug* & EV_RILU_1_1_76
Ar - Who cares. Anyway, we seem to be a bit stuck here. Do you wanna join us? & EV_RILU_1_1_77

Ri - Were you the one calling me cute? & EV_RILU_1_1_80
Ar - Guilty.  & EV_RILU_1_1_81
Ri - Are you fooling me? & EV_RILU_1_1_82
Ar - Why would I be? & EV_RILU_1_1_83
Arron said it sincerely, but after taking a glance at his friends, he spotted their uneasiness. & EV_RILU_1_1_84
Ri - Huh... a weird man. & EV_RILU_1_1_85
Ri - Fine. I'll accompany you. & EV_RILU_1_1_86
Ro - But before that, Rilu, could you tell us what were you doing in that coffin?  & EV_RILU_1_1_87
Ri - ... & EV_RILU_1_1_88
Ri - I fell in there a long time ago.  & EV_RILU_1_1_89
Ri - I think it was cursed and the lid closed on its own. & EV_RILU_1_1_90
Ro - Really? This is... something I can probably imagine. & EV_RILU_1_1_91
Ar - Alright, let's try to get out. & EV_RILU_1_1_92
